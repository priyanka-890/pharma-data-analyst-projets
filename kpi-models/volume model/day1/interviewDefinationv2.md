# Day 1 — Volume Model  
## Interview-Ready Framework (Pharma Analytics)

## PBM Statement (Problem-Based Mindset)

### Problem  
Prescription volume for a chronic therapy has declined.

### Mindset  
Before analyzing revenue, pricing, or discounts, I first determine whether the decline is driven by a **change in activity** — such as fewer prescribers, reduced engagement, or lower participation.

### Why  
Because **Sales = Price × Volume**, isolating volume first ensures I correctly identify the **root behavioral driver** before interpreting financial impact.

### Outcome  
This approach prevents incorrect narratives, maintains analytical rigor, and aligns with best practices in pharma analytics.

## 🎤 Interview Storytelling — Volume Model

### How I Approach the Situation

Whenever performance declines in a pharmaceutical business, the **first model I apply is the volume model**.

My goal is not to explain revenue immediately — it is to understand whether **activity itself has changed**.  
Volume tells me what doctors, patients, or participants are doing, independent of price or financial levers.

---

## What the Volume Model Measures

The volume model measures **how much activity is happening** in the business.

In pharma, activity is reflected through:
- Prescriptions written  
- Number of active prescribers  
- Patients on therapy  
- Adverse event counts  
- Clinical trial enrollments  

These are **behavioral signals**, not financial outcomes.

---

## When I Use the Volume Model

I apply the volume model whenever:
- Sales decline  
- Growth slows  
- Prescription counts decrease  

At that point, my first question is always:

> **Is performance changing because fewer actions are happening?**

Only after answering this do I move to revenue or pricing models.

---

## Why Volume Analysis Matters

Volume analysis focuses on **behavioral change**, not money.

It answers one core question:

> **What changed in activity or participation?**

By keeping the analysis behavioral, I avoid mixing causes and effects — a common analytical mistake.

---

## KPIs I Look At

I never rely on a single metric. Instead, I look at a **system of volume KPIs**, including:
- Total prescription volume  
- Monthly prescription trends  
- Month-over-month changes  
- Number of active prescribers  
- Prescriptions per prescriber  
- New versus repeat prescriptions  

There is no “wrong” KPI here — each one helps triangulate the story.

---

## Interview Scenario: Prescription Volume Decline

Prescription volume for a chronic therapy has declined over the last three months, and management wants to understand why.

---

## Step 1: Clarify the Decline

Before diagnosing causes, I clarify the pattern:
- Is the decline consistent across all three months or driven by a one-time drop?
- Is it gradual or sudden?
- Is this a short-term issue or part of a longer-term trend?

This prevents premature conclusions.

---

## Step 2: Identify the Volume Driver

Next, I decompose volume into two components:
- **Number of prescribers**
- **Prescriptions per prescriber**

This tells me where the volume is breaking:
- Fewer prescribers → **adoption issue**
- Same prescribers writing fewer prescriptions → **engagement issue**

This distinction is foundational.

---

## Step 3: New vs. Repeat Prescription Diagnostic

I then examine **new versus repeat prescriptions**:
- New prescriptions declining with stable repeats → adoption issue  
- Repeat prescriptions declining → potential adherence or persistence concern  

However, I am careful not to over-interpret.

---

## A Critical Principle

> **Volume analysis never starts with money.**

### Why this is correct:
- Sales = Price × Volume  
- Activity change must be isolated first  
- Otherwise, financial narratives become misleading  
- Strong analysts always **decompose before interpreting**

---

## Why I Avoid Revenue, Pricing, and Discounts Early

I intentionally say **no** to revenue, price, and discounts at this stage because:
- They belong to **revenue and pricing models**
- Introducing them too early creates incorrect narratives
- In pharma, this raises compliance and ethical risks  

Avoiding them demonstrates **analytical hygiene**.

---

## Why I Avoid Assuming Patient Dropout

I avoid concluding patient dropout or adherence issues unless I have **supporting data**.

Why?
- Dropout implies persistence failure  
- That requires longitudinal, patient-level data  
- Volume trends alone cannot prove it  

This reflects **scientific rigor**, not hesitation.

---

## End-to-End Interview Framework

### 1️⃣ Performance — What Happened  
Prescription volume declined, indicating reduced activity.

### 2️⃣ Driver — Why It Happened  
The decline may be driven by fewer prescribers, lower engagement per prescriber, or shifts in new versus repeat prescriptions.

### 3️⃣ Interpretation — What It Means  
This is a behavioral change, not a pricing or revenue issue.

### 4️⃣ Action — What to Do Safely  
Deepen volume diagnostics, validate hypotheses with the right data, and only then expand into adherence, persistence, or downstream revenue analysis.

## Final Interview Soundbite

> *“When performance declines, I always start with volume.  
> I want to understand whether activity changed before interpreting financial impact.  
> That keeps the analysis causal, clean, and scientifically sound.”*
