# Volume Model

**Volume** refers to how much activity is happening in a system.

In the pharmaceutical context, volume represents **counts**, not revenue. It is used to measure **usage, adoption, or participation**, rather than financial performance.

## What Volume Represents in Pharma

Volume may include counts such as:

- Patient counts  
- Prescriber counts  
- Prescription counts  
- Adverse event counts  
- Clinical trial enrollments  

## When to Use the Volume Model

The **volume model** is applied when the goal is to understand:

- System or product usage  
- Market adoption  
- Participation levels  

Whenever performance is described as **declining**, the **first model to apply** should be the volume model.  
This helps determine whether the issue is due to a **reduction in activity itself**, before analyzing pricing or revenue-related factors.

## Why These KPIs Belong in the First 5–15 Minutes

This section is about **understanding the volume model**, not performing deep root-cause analysis.

Each KPI answers a very specific question:

- **Total prescription volume**  
  → Is overall activity up or down?

- **Monthly prescription trend**  
  → Is the change gradual or sudden?

- **Month-over-month (MoM) prescription volume change**  
  → How fast is activity changing?

- **Number of prescribers**  
  → Is adoption shrinking?

- **Prescriptions per prescriber**  
  → Is engagement weakening?

- **New vs. repeat prescriptions**  
  → Is this an adoption issue or a usage issue?

📌 **Taken together, these KPIs answer one core question:**

> *Is the problem driven by fewer people participating, or by less activity from the same people?*

This is exactly what **strong Volume Model thinking** is designed to uncover.
