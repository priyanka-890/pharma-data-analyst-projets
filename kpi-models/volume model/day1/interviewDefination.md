# Volume Model — Interview-Ready Definition

The **volume model** measures how much activity is happening in the business.

In the pharmaceutical industry, volume includes metrics such as:
- Prescriptions written
- Number of prescribers
- Patients on therapy
- Adverse event counts
- Clinical trial enrollments

## When to Use the Volume Model

I typically start with the **volume model whenever performance declines**.  
This approach helps determine whether the issue is driven by:
- Reduced usage  
- Lower adoption  
- Fewer participants  

before analyzing revenue, pricing, or financial impact.

## Why Volume Analysis Matters

Volume analysis focuses on **behavioral change**, not financial outcomes.  
It answers the question: *What changed in activity or participation?*

# Core KPIs

- Total prescription volume  
- Monthly prescription volume trend  
- Month-over-month (MoM) prescription volume change  
- Number of active prescribers  
- Prescriptions per prescriber  
- New vs repeat prescriptions  

✔️ No KPI here is wrong.

# Interview-Ready Framing: When to Apply the Volume Model

If sales are said to have dropped, the first thing I think about is **volume**, to determine whether the decline is driven by reduced activity before analyzing revenue or pricing.

If growth has slowed, I consider **volume alongside growth trends** to understand whether the slowdown is due to lower activity levels or a change in the growth rate over time.

If prescriptions have decreased, I directly apply the **prescription volume model**, since this is a pure activity-based signal.


# Interview-Ready Problem Framing: Prescription Volume Decline(Clarify the Problem_)

Prescription volume for a chronic therapy drug has declined over the past three months, and management wants to understand why.

The first set of questions I would ask are:

- Is the decline consistent across the last three months, or is it driven by a one-time drop?
- Is the decline gradual or sudden in nature?
- Is this decline observed only in the recent months, or is it part of a longer-term trend across the year?Is this a short-term issue or part of a longer-term trend?


## Identifying the Driver of Volume Decline

To identify the driver of a volume decline, I compare the **number of prescribers** with **prescriptions per prescriber**.

- If the number of prescribers decreases, it indicates an **adoption issue**.
- If the same prescribers are writing fewer prescriptions, it points to an **engagement issue**.

## Interview-Ready Diagnostic: New vs. Repeat Prescriptions

To further understand the volume decline, I examine **new versus repeat prescriptions**.

- If new prescriptions are declining while repeat prescriptions remain stable, this indicates an **adoption issue**.
- If repeat prescriptions are declining, it may point to a potential **adherence or persistence issue**, which would require further validation.

## Interview-Ready Principle: How to Think About Volume Analysis

Volume analysis never starts with money.

When analyzing volume, I explicitly avoid jumping to revenue, pricing, or discounts, because **volume is about activity, not financial impact**.

I also avoid concluding patient dropout or adherence issues unless there is **specific supporting data**.

## Why This Statement Is Correct (Very Important)

### ✔️ “Volume analysis never starts with money”

This is correct because:
- **Sales = Price × Volume**
- You must isolate **activity change** first
- Otherwise, causes and effects get mixed
- Senior analysts always **decompose before interpreting**

---

### ✔️ Saying “NO” to revenue, price, and discounts

This is correct because:
- These belong to **revenue and pricing models**
- Introducing them too early leads to **incorrect narratives**
- This is especially risky in **pharma** due to compliance and ethics
- Avoiding them shows strong **analytical hygiene**

---

### ✔️ Saying “NO” to patient dropout without data

This is very important and reflects analytical maturity.

Why?
- Dropout implies **adherence or persistence**
- That requires **longitudinal patient-level data**
- **Volume data alone cannot prove it**

This caution demonstrates **scientific thinking** and disciplined analysis.

## Interview-Ready Framework: Volume Analysis(story telling)

### 1️⃣ Performance — What Happened  
Prescription volume has declined over the past few months, indicating a reduction in overall activity.

### 2️⃣ Driver — Why It Happened  
The decline may be driven by fewer active prescribers (an adoption issue), lower prescriptions per prescriber (an engagement issue), or changes in new versus repeat prescriptions.

### 3️⃣ Interpretation — What It Means  
This suggests a behavioral change in participation or usage, not a financial or pricing issue. Further breakdown is required before attributing causes such as adherence or dropout.

### 4️⃣ Action — What to Do Safely  
Deepen volume diagnostics first, validate hypotheses with appropriate data, and only then expand analysis to adherence, persistence, or downstream revenue models.


# Adherence interventions refer to actions or programs designed to help patients take their medication correctly and consistently over time, as prescribed.


# Final Interview Soundbite (Strong Close)

“When performance declines, I always start with volume.
I want to understand whether activity changed before interpreting financial impact.
